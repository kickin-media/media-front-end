# Kick-In Media Front-end
_Front-end for the Kick-In Media App. Communicates with the corresponding back-end in this GitHub organization._

**Requirements:**

- [Back-end](https://github.com/kickin-media/media-back-end/)
- [Auth0 App Token](https://auth0.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(developed on NodeJS v18.7.0)_

## Getting started

1. Install packages with `npm install`.
2. Run development instance with `npm start`.
3. Happy coding!


## Adapting the front-end for your use-case
The `src/` directory contains the general codebase of the tool and can easily be adapted for
other events/goals/associations (as long as you have a running back-end and all other requirements
in order). See example use cases in the `projects/` directory (and corresponding config in
`angular.json`).

By creating your own sub-project (in your own repository ofc) you can easily set up your own
photo tool!
